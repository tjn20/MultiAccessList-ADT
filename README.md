# MultiAccessList-ADT

## Overview
MultiAccessKeyList is a powerful Keyed Abstract Data Type (ADT) designed for sequential access. It employs a hashing mechanism to generate indices based on keys, resolving collisions through linked chaining. The hashTable array is utilized for storing hashed key values and forming linked chains for identical indices. Simultaneously, the positionAccess array is updated to maintain sequential access.
